Environment build:
1.Do not use the Samsung SSD,its can not be pass the check.(I use the WD Black 500G)
2.Your computer maybe break (lke me) ,The BIOS can not open or other bad thing happened.
3.If you buy the WWAN card. Sadly to tell you hackintosh can not use it.
4.If you want to use the Wifi,you need to install the software  "Heliport".
